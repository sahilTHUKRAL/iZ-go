7 Vastu Principles You Should Use in Duplex House Plans

Vastu is an ancient Indian knowledge related to design of buildings &amp; its Principles &amp; rules help in design of a House. A house designed on the basis of Vastu is considered to bring in good fortune, overall health, happiness &amp; prosperity to the whole family. Vastu Principles are as much relevant today as they were important in the past.

The real knowledge of Vastu if employed correctly can result in a a house that helps in overall growth of prosperity, wealth, health &amp; happiness for the whole family.

I’m listing 7 Vastu Principles of house design which should be used while designing your dream home.

1. South West Portion of the house should be the tallest part &amp; should be used for Master Bedroom or for Master’s living.
2. North East portion of the house should be light &amp; well ventilated &amp; the underground water tank should be located in this area.
3. Toilets inside the house should be located on the West or South side &amp; should be avoided on the East &amp; North sides.
4. Kitchen should be located in the South East portion of the house &amp; no water element or supply should be kept in the South East.
5. Staircase inside the house should be located in the South or West portion &amp; avoided in North East &amp; North side. Staircase should always be clock wise while climbing up &amp; should start from North direction climbing towards South or from East direction climbing towards west.
6. Main gate &amp; main door of the house should be in the North East side &amp; should be avoided in South West.
7. More area should be left on the East &amp; North side of the house compared to South &amp; West. Leaving space all around the house is best as it brings in proper ventilation &amp; helps in the growth of overall prosperity.
