The future of Office working that solves our transportation problem &amp; makes our cities congestion free.

Imagine a Sphere, I call it <strong>iWSphere</strong>, short for interactive work sphere, a place which contains everything you need, to work remotely, as well as interact with all your office co workers, colleagues, boss or client in real time, interacting face to face or should I say body to body as body language is equally important while conversing. How about a little friendly chat with that new girl in the office or having a football discussion with your friends near the coffee machine?? Can all this be achieved without stepping out of your home?

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-222" src="http://iz-go.freesubdomain.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Future-Office-4-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" />

A full &amp; complete Virtual office experience with 360 degrees of visual connectivity with the best office environment, or choose to change it, if you wish. Don’t want pesky colleagues disturbing you, switch to the cityscape &amp; view the New York City down below or a bright sunny day, as if you were outdoors, perfectly matched with the exact outdoor conditions, to keep you &amp; your body, totally in sync with the outside world. Want to interact with the collegue in the next cubicle, simply tap to invite him or her and see him walk over to your cubicle. Simply stand up and start chatting or exchanging ideas. Connect as many cubicles of colleagues you want and have a full office experience.

This iWShpere is a physical space composed of a 5’-0” x 5’-0” cubicle space with computer and working desk for you to work, the sides of this sphere is made of interactive curved  LED panels, including the roof, the cameras inside project your 360degrees world to other users of this <strong>iWSphere</strong> and similarly you too get connected to the others. Its like a phone booth, but a much more advanced version of it, its an interactive pod, completely integrated with all visual and audio functions and fully connected to the outside world. Inside this iWSphere you will feel completely connected to your work place, complete with your colleagues and friends.

The iWSphere is small &amp; consumes much less power, comes fully air conditioned with heating &amp; cooling, has curved led displays and ultra modern work station. Upgraded models can have a coffee machine, printers (for couriering hard copies), etc. The iWSphere is small &amp; compact &amp; can be assembled at home or your beach cabin by yourself easily &amp; it’s just plug &amp; play.

The overall size of this iWSphere will be a sphere of 8’-0” diameter and can be installed at all possible locations, such as hotel lobbies, your house, libraries, public spaces, etc. This sphere will immediately recognise you and change the atmosphere &amp; environment to your personal settings, even if you use the ones in the hotel.

The future of office working is here, employers need not spend excessive amounts on expensive office spaces, perks &amp; travel allowances &amp; can expect to hire more than 90% of their employees, to work remotely, yet interact with each other in real time.
