Custom Designed House plans are the best way to design and build your dream home. A custom designed house plan will ensure that the design is made as per your requirements, such as:
<ol>
 	<li>Number of bedrooms required including guest bedrooms</li>
 	<li>Number of bathrooms &amp; toilets required, maybe you want a powder room for your guests</li>
 	<li>Storage requirements including walk-in wardrobes &amp; dress areas</li>
 	<li>Other rooms such as Kitchen, Living, Dining, Puja, etc. can be designed as per your requirement of sizes and locations.</li>
 	<li>Number of floors</li>
 	<li>Adding Gym or study rooms or even small office spaces</li>
 	<li>Adding a Maidâ€™s room</li>
 	<li>Maybe you want a swimming pool or a wading pool on the terrace</li>
 	<li>Vastu compliant</li>
 	<li>Plot Size &amp; Orientation</li>
 	<li>Ventilation requirements</li>
 	<li>Car Parking requirements</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

So, whether you are looking for a Duplex House for your family or a house with rental portions, it is very important that the house plans are designed for your specific requirements and that the house plan will fit within your plot size and has proper entry as per the road direction and location.

It is also important to know what the surrounding area of the plot has and this helps in proper planning for ventilation and service areas.

A Custom Designed House Plan is the best way to design and build your dream home and when you get such facilities as Online Ordering and affordable pricing, then it makes all the more sense.
